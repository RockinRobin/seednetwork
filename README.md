About the Hilltown Seed Saving Network 
--------------------------------------
The Hilltown Seed Saving Network of western Massachusetts is a loosely organized group working to educate ourselves and our neighbors about seed saving and currently creating a virtual local seed bank, sharing information about what seeds we have in our own collections and how best to grow them. We are from Cummington, Chesterfield, Plainfield, Worthington, Windsor, Goshen, Ashfield and surrounding towns in the region and meet monthly in Cummington. All are welcome!
