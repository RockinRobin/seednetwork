	Around the country farmers and gardeners are rediscovering the importance and pleasure of growing heritage and landrace grains. Their flavor, high nutrient content, adaptability to a range of conditions, beauty, and interesting histories compel us to become involved in a time of climate change and alarming loss of diversity.
	<br /><br />
	This site offers the opportunity for members to share seeds, knowledge, and experience and to network with other growers. We hope eventually to identify outstanding varieties that can be shared with other farmers, grown out in larger quantity, and tested for baking qualities and other uses. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Who are we? <br />
	Sylvia and Ruth are both Vermont gardeners with seed saving backgrounds who have been increasingly drawn to ancient grains over the last few years.
	We created this website to facilitate connections among those who are growing and using grains, on whatever scale, and with the hope that it will encourage more widespread cultivation and use.
	We are especially grateful to Eli Rogosa for her pioneering work in reviving interest in heritage grains.
