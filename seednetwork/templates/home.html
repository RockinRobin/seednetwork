<p>
Around the country farmers and gardeners are rediscovering the importance and pleasure of growing heritage and landrace grains. Their flavor, high nutrient content, adaptability to a range of conditions, and interesting histories compel us to become involved in a time of climate change and alarming loss of diversity.
<br /><br />
This site offers the opportunity to share your knowledge and experience and to network with other growers. You can use your profile page to tell others about yourself and your work, describe the varieties you grow and the scope of your projects, and initiate collaboration on trials. One of our primary objectives in launching this site is to promote the sharing of seeds. We hope members' seed trials will help identify outstanding varieties that can be shared with farmers, grown out in larger quantity, and tested for baking qualities.

		Who are we? <br />
		Sylvia and Ruth are both Vermont gardeners with seed saving backgrounds who have been increasingly drawn to ancient grains over the last few years.
	        We are enchanted by their beauty, divesity, nourishment, and histories.
		We created this website to facilitate connections among thos who are growing and using grains, on whatever scale, and with the hope that it will encourage more widespread cultivation and use.
		 We are especially grateful to Eli Rogosa for her pioneering work in reviving interest in heritage grains.
